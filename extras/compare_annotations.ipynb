Nevertheless, there are some additional cases, which are not found by the automatic validation. Therefore the automatic validation result above must be interpreted as the minimum number of recordings with inconsistencies. Below the two major reasonings are explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In _v3.0.0-alpha_, there were several recordings, where the tonic frequency/symbol varies throughout the recording (e.g. [Isfahan Peşrev by Mesut Cemil](http://musicbrainz.org/recording/ed189797-5c50-4fde-abfa-cb1c8a2a2571)). This variation was not annotated so the tonic informaiton is partiall true. \n",
    "    \n",
    "  Most of these recordings have been removed due to the rigor in re-annotating or the ambiguity in where the change occurs (e.g. in geçiş taksims). See [removed.json](https://github.com/MTG/otmm_tonic_dataset/blob/master/removed.json) for detailed reasonings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- As seen from the output warning for the validation test, only 2007 - 1589 = 418 recordings (~20% of the dataset) have been validated. Therefore, the coverage of the automatic validation is not adequate in _v3.0.0-alpha_. Note that the human annotators show inconsistencies in 5.5% of the tested recordings. \n",
    "\n",
    "  To compensate, we added the automatic tonic annotations obtained by joint analysis. Next, the recordings with automatic annotations went thorough a final verification by a human annotator. After verification 789 (in 782 recordings, see the statistics printed in the 6th cell, below.) automatic annotations were found to be correct and the rest of automatic annotations are discarded (<20 annotations; less than 2.4% error). The accuracy of the automatic annotation method less than but is similar to the 99% accuracy reported in the original paper (Şentürk, S., Gulati, S., and Serra, X., 2013) and better than humans annotators. \n",
